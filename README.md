# Sentiment-Analysis-using-Naive-Bayes

The aim of the project was to use Naive  Bayes classification algorithm for Sentiment Analysis. We are given a set of reviews about movies and labels which tell if the reviews are positive or negative. The model needs to predict if the review is a positive one or a negative one when a review is given as an input. No built-in library has been used. The Naive Bayes algorithm is hard coded.

naive_bayes_data.txt file contains data in raw format. So, first data is stored in a proper format with labels and then the Naive Bayes algorithm is applied to predict the output. For detailed description, look at the report.
